### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/ay2122s1-cs2103t-f13-1/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/ay2122s1-cs2103t-f13-1/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/ay2122s1-cs2103t-f13-1/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)
(Note: Implementation of NavigationButton and ViewPanel class diagram are referenced below.)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g. `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ViewPanel`, `NavigationButton` etc. 
All these, except for `GroupButtonListener` and `PersonButtonListner` in `NavigationButton`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/ay2122s1-cs2103t-f13-1/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/ay2122s1-cs2103t-f13-1/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

<img src="images/UiViewPanelDiagram.png" width="450" />

The `ViewPanel` consist of the following parts:
* `GroupListPanel`
* `ContactListPanel`
* `ExpenseListPanel`
* `PaymentListPanel`

Each panel will display the corresponding list accordingly. The ViewPanel will only show up a single list panel at a time. 
We have decided to opt for this way of implementation due to the following:
* Able to make use of existing AB3 implementation of `PersonList`
* Will not increase code complexity as compared to both list using the same panel.
* Able to toggle easily with CLI commands

In addition to using CLI command, we will also be implementing the toggling of list panel with the use of buttons.

<img src="images/UiNavigationButtonDiagram.png" width="450" />

The `NavigationButtonPanel` consist of the following parts:
* GroupViewButton
* ContactViewButton

Clicking each button will show the respective list view in `ViewPanel`. The clicking of the button is handled by `EventHandler`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/ay2122s1-cs2103t-f13-1/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a contact).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

<img src="images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png" width="600" />

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/ay2122s1-cs2103t-f13-1/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="700" />
<br>
(Note: Implementation of Person, Group and Expense class diagram are referenced below.)

The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data
    * all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
    * all `Group` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueGroupList` object).
    * all `Expense` objects (which are contained in a `ExpenseList` object).
    * all `Payment` objects (which are contained in a `PaymentList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person`/`Group`/`Expense`/`Payment` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<img src="images/PersonClassDiagram.png" width="450" />
<img src="images/ExpenseClassDiagram.png" width="350" />
<img src="images/GroupClassDiagram.png" width="450" />
<img src="images/PaymentClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/ay2122s1-cs2103t-f13-1/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.awe.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Create Group Feature

The create group mechanism is facilitated by defining a Group model and adding a Unique Group List field to 
`AddressBook`. The Group model contains a `GroupName` field containing the name of the group, an `ArrayList` of `Person`
objects who are members of the Group, an `ArrayList` of `Expense` objects that keeps track of the expenditures of the 
Group, a `HashMap` that contains details of how much each member has paid in total across the expenses, and a `HashMap`
that contains details of the total expenditure incurred by each member across the trip.

The following activity diagram shows what happens when a user executes a `createGroup` command.

![CreateGroupActivityDiagram](images/CreateGroupActivityDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `creategroup` mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. A valid `creategroup` command is given as user input. This prompts the `LogicManager` to run its execute()
method.

Step 2. The `CreateGroupCommandParser` parses the input and checks for presence of the relevant prefixes.
It also checks that the group name is valid and all members specified are in the contact list.
It returns a `CreateGroupCommand`.

Step 3. `CreateGroupCommand` runs its execute() method which checks if a group with the same name has already been
created. If not, the newly created group is added into the AWE model and all members within the group are updated in
the model. Upon successful execution, `CommandResult` is returned.

The following sequence operation shows how the `creategroup` operation works.
![CreateGroupSequenceDiagram](images/CreateGroupSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `CreateGroupCommandParser`
should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

![CreateGroupRef](images/CreateGroupRef.png)

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: User command for `creategroup`:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create Travel Group with specified members and tags.
    * Pros: Intuitive for user to create a travel group with specified members and tags.
    * Pros: Provides user with convenience of setting up a travel group with minimal commands.
    * Cons: Harder to implement.
    * Cons: Easier for user to make an erroneous command.


* **Alternative 2 :** Create Travel Group only.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Pros: Command has single responsibility. Easy to remember the sole purpose of `creategroup` command.
    * Cons: Unintuitive for user as travel group is created without any members or tags.
    * Cons: Inconvenient for user to use multiple commands to set up a travel group.


* **Justification**
    * User will have at least one member in mind when creating a group.
    * As such, it is only natural for the `creategroup` command to support addition of members and tags into the group
      upon creation.
    * This minimizes the number of commands a user has to make in setting up a functional Group.
    * As such, it is better to choose Alternative 1, as this provides the user with a far better user experience.


### Delete Group Feature

The delete group mechanism is facilitated by maintaining the constraint that every `Group` has a unique `GroupName`.
This allows the `Model` class to easily retrieve the Group based on the name entered by the user and remove the group from the model.

The following activity diagram shows what happens when a user executes a `deletegroup` command.

![DeleteGroupActivityDiagram](images/DeleteGroupActivityDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `deletegroup` mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. A valid `deletegroup` command is given as user input. This prompts the `LogicManager` to run its execute()
method.

Step 2. The `DeleteGroupCommandParser` parses the input and checks for presence of the relevant prefixes.
It also checks that the group name is valid (does not have any non-alphanumeric characters).
It returns a `DeleteGroupCommand`.

Step 3. `DeleteGroupCommand` runs its execute() method which checks if a group with the same name has been
created in the past. If so, this group is retrieved from the model. Subsequently, the group is removed from the addressbook.
Upon successful execution, `CommandResult` is returned.


The following sequence operation shows how the `deletegroup` operation works.
![DeleteGroupSequenceDiagram](images/DeleteGroupSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteGroupCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: User command for deletegroup:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Delete based on `GroupName`
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Pros: Difficult for user to make an erroneous command.
    * Cons: Long user command.  
    * Cons: Requires imposition of constraint that group names are unique.
    

* **Alternative 2 (index based):** Delete based on index position in `ObservableList`
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Pros: Short user command  
    * Cons: Unintuitive for user.
    * Cons: Easy for user to make an erroneous command.
    

* **Justification**
    * Group contains large mass of information such as multiple expenses, individual expenditures, and payments.
    * This information is unrecoverable once deleted.
    * As such, it is better to choose Alternative 1, as this makes it difficult for user to accidentally delete a group.

**Aspect: Internal delete mechanism:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Retrieve group from list and delete
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Pros: Easier to modify in future.
  * Cons: Extra step of retrieval leads to slower execution.
  

* **Alternative 2 (name based):** Delete based on `GroupName`
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Pros: Process is completed faster.
  * Cons: Might cause issues in case of future modifications.
  

* **Justification**
  * Retrieving the group and subsequently deleting the group is a slower process.
  * However, the alternative implementation relies on the uniqueness of the `GroupName` field of `Group` objects.
  * Should we modify or remove the constraint, the alternative implementation would require significant alterations.
  * To make the feature more extendable, we choose alternative 1.

### Group Add Contact Feature
![GroupAddContactSequenceDiagram](images/GroupAddContactSequenceDiagram.png)


### Group Remove Contact Feature
![GroupRemoveContactSequenceDiagram](images/GroupRemoveContactSequenceDiagram.png)

### Group Add Tag Feature
![GroupAddTagSequenceDiagram](images/GroupAddTagSequenceDiagram.png)

### Group Remove Tag Feature
![GroupRemoveTagSequenceDiagram](images/GroupRemoveTagSequenceDiagram.png)

### Group Edit Name Feature
![GroupEditNameSequenceDiagram](images/GroupEditNameSequenceDiagram.png)

### Find group feature

The find group feature supports both single keyword and multi keyword search. This allows the displayed view panel to show the entries related to the search keywords entered by the user.

The following activity diagram shows what happens when a user executes a `findgroups` command:

<img src="images/FindGroupsActivityDiagram.png" width="350" />

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `findgroup` operation behaves at each step:

Assuming the programs only have the initial data when the user first starts the app, the `FilteredList` should contain only 2 groups - London and Bali.

Step 1. When the user executes `findgroups London` command, the message is passed into `LogicManager` and parsed by `AddressBookParser`.

Step 2. `FindGroupsCommandParser` is created and the arguments are parsed by it. The arguments are used to create `GroupContainsKeywordsPredicate` and `FindGroupsCommand` is returned to the `LogicManager`.

Step 3. The `LogicManager` then calls `FindGroupCommand#execute(model)` method, which updated the `FilteredList<Group>` in `ModelManager`. Thereafter, the `FilteredList<Group>` should contains only London.

Step 4. The GUI listens for updates in the `FilteredList<Group>` and updates the display to display London only.

Step 5. `CommandResult` is returned to the `LogicManager`, which also switches the view panel to `GroupsListPanel` if needed. See UI implementation below for more details of switching view panel.

Step 6. The output from `CommandResult` is then displayed as an output for the user.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `findgroups` operation works:

<img src="images/FindGroupsSequenceDiagram.png" width="600" />


### Add expense feature

The add expense mechanism is facilitated by defining an Expense model and adding an Expense List field to
`AddressBook`. The Expense model contains a `Person` field containing the payer of the Expense, a `Cost` field
containing the cost of the expense, a `List` of `Person` objects that keeps track of the people involved in the
expense, a `HashMap` that contains details of how much each member has paid in total for the expense.

The following activity diagram shows what happens when a user executes a `addexpense` command.

![AddExpenseActivityDiagram](images/AddExpenseActivityDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `addexpense` mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. A valid `addexpense` command is given as user input. This prompts the `LogicManager` to run its execute()
method.

Step 2. The `AddExpenseCommandParser` parses the input and checks for presence of the relevant prefixes.
It also checks that the group name is valid and all members specified are in the specified group.
It returns a `AddExpenseCommand`.

Step 3. `AddExpenseCommand` runs its execute() method which adds the newly created expense involving the into the
relevant group members into the group and the group is updated in the AWE model.Upon successful execution,
`CommandResult` is returned.

The following sequence operation shows how the `addexpense` operation works.
![AddExpenseSequenceDiagram](images/AddExpenseSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `AddExpenseCommandParser`
should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: User command for `addexpense`:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create Expense with specified group and group members.
    * Pros: Intuitive for user to create an expense with specified group and group members via their names.
    * Pros: Provides user with convenience of creating an expense with minimal input.
    * Cons: Harder to implement.
    * Cons: Easier for user to make an erroneous command.


* **Alternative 2 (index based):** Create Expense with based on index position in `ObservableList`.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: Inconvenient for user to add an expense as they have to check again the index of both the person and group.
    * Cons: Easy for user to make an erroneous command.

* **Justification**
    * Each person has a unique name and the implementation for adding an expense based on a person's and group's 
      name is simple.
    * Users may need a long time to find the index of a person or group if the list of either is very long.
    * Hence, adding expenses based on the specified person and group name is more appropriate.

### Find Expenses Feature

The find expenses mechanism is facilitated by `Group`. Each group has a unique group name and also an expense list 
required for finding expenses within a group.

The following activity diagram shows what happens when a user executes a `findexpenses` command.

![FindExpensesActivityDiagram](images/FindExpensesActivityDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `findexpenses` mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes a valid `findexpenses eat gn/London` command. This prompts the `LogicManager` 
to run its execute() method.

Step 2. The `FindExpensesCommandParser` parses the input and checks for presence of the group name prefix.
It also checks that the group name is valid (does not have any non-alphanumeric characters). The arguments are 
used to create `DescriptionContainsKeywordsPredicate` and `FindExpensesCommand` is returned to the `LogicManager`.

Step 3. The `LogicManager` then calls `FindExpensesCommand#execute(model)` method, which updates the 
`FilteredList<Expense>` in `ModelManager` using the predicate created in step 2.

Step 4. The GUI listens for updates in the `FilteredList<Expense>` and updates the display accordingly.

Step 5. `CommandResult` is returned to the `LogicManager`, which also switches the viewpanel to `ExpensesListPanel` if needed.

Step 6. The output from `CommandResult` is then displayed as an output for the user.


The following sequence operation shows how the `findexpenses` operation works.
![FindExpensesSequenceDiagram](images/FindExpensesSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteGroupCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: User command for findexpenses:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Find based on `GroupName`
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: Long user command if group name is long.
    * Cons: Requires imposition of constraint that group names are unique.


* **Alternative 2 (index based):** Find expenses in the group indicated by index position in `ObservableList`
    * Pros: Short user command with just the index.
    * Cons: User need to check for the right index of the group.
    * Cons: Easy for user to make an erroneous command.


* **Justification**
    * Each group has a unique name and the implementation for finding a group based on the group name is simple. 
    * Users may need a long time to find the index of a group if the list of groups is very long.
    * Hence, finding expenses based on the specified group name is more appropriate.


### Delete Expense Feature

The delete expense mechanism is facilitated by the addition of an `ExpenseList` field within the `AddressBook` object maintained by the model.
Each `Expense` belongs to a `Group` object, also maintained within the `AddressBook`.
Deletion of an expense must be accompanied by deletion of the expense from the `Group` object to which it belongs.
The command allows the user to delete an expense based on the index position of the expense in the page viewed by the user.
This means that the user is constrained to only being permitted to delete expenses when they are viewing a list of expenses; that is, after they enter the `findexpenses` or `expenses` command.

The following activity diagram shows what happens when a user executes a `deleteexpense` command.

![DeleteExpenseActivityDiagram](images/DeleteExpenseActivityDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `deleteexpense` mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. A valid `deleteexpense` command is given as user input. This prompts the `LogicManager` to run its execute()
method.

Step 2. The `DeleteExpenseCommandParser` parses the input and checks for presence of the `INDEX` input.
It returns a `DeleteExpenseCommand`.

Step 3. `DeleteExpenseCommand` runs its execute() method which checks if the `INDEX` entered is within the range of the size of the list of expneses seen by the user.
If so, the `Expense` at the `INDEX` position is deleted from the `ExpenseList`. The `ObservableList` within `ExpenseList` is updated, meaniing the UI updates and the user can see the new list of expenses, without the deleted expense.

Step 4. The `Group` to which this expense belongs is retrieved from the `ExpenseList`.
The expense is subsequently deleted from the `expenses` field present in the `Group` object.
The updated `Group` is then placed back into the `GroupList` within the `AddressBook`.

Step 5: Upon successful execution, `CommandResult` is returned.


The following sequence operation shows how the `deleteexpense` operation works.
![DeleteExpenseSequenceDiagram](images/DeleteExpenseSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteExpenseCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: User command for deleteexpense:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Delete based on index position in `ObservableList`
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Pros: Short user command.
    * Cons: Less intuitive for user.
    * Cons: Easy for user to make an erroneous command.

* **Alternative 2 (description based):** Delete based on `description`
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Pros: Difficult for user to make an erroneous command.
    * Cons: Long user command.
    * Cons: Requires imposition of constraint that expense description names are unique.


* **Justification**
    * Expenses, unlike Groups, do not contain a large volume of information.
    * This information is unrecoverable once deleted.
    * However, the damage to a user as a result of an error is not significant. The user can re-enter the details with a single command.
    * Therefore, the need to protect the user from erroneous decisions is not significant.
    * Furthermore, many expenses are likely to have similar descriptions. Constraining users to using unique descriptions for expenses is likely to compromise the user experience.
    * As such, it is better to choose Alternative 1, as this allows the user to quickly delete expenses, and not compromise on the flexibility of the user.

### Calculate Payments Feature

The purpose of this feature is to provide users with a simple set of transactions that would allow all debts within the group to be settled.
The UI mechanism is facilitated by the addition of a `PaymentList` field of `Payment` objects, present within the `AddressBook` object maintained by the model.
The functionality of this feature is facilitated by the fact that group objects maintain two hashmaps: -
* `paidByPayers`, which maintains how much each member of the group has paid (total payments) during the course of the trip.
* `splitExpenses`, which maintains how much expenditure each member of the group has incurred (total expenditure) during the course of the trip.
These maps allow calculations with respect to how much each individual is owed, and how much each individual owes.
  
#### The Algorithm
The invariant maintained is that the sum of all payments made (values within `paidByPayers`) should equal the total expenditures incurred by the group (values within `splitExpenses`).
Define surplus as the net amount each individual is owed by others. This ultimately means that some members have negative surplus, and some have positive surplus.
The goal is to ensure that the deficits balance the surpluses with the minimum number of transactions.
To assist with the tracking of each individual and their surplus, an inner `Pair` class was created with a `Person` field and a primitive double field for the surplus.

* Initialise an empty list of Pairs and an empty list of `Payment` objects.

* Iterate through the `members` of the group and retrieve each individual's total payments and total expenditures.

* Calculate the surplus of each individual by subtracting their total expenditures from their total payments.
Initialise a `Pair` object with the `Person` object of the individual, and their surplus. Add this pair to the list if the surplus is not 0.

* Iterate until the list is empty and perform the following steps.
  * Sort the list in ascending order of surplus. This means that those who owe more are placed in the earlier part of the list and those who are owed more are placed towards the end of the `Pair` list.
  * Retrieve the first `Pair` and last `Pair` in the list. It is invariant that the first pair will have negative surplus and the last pair will have positive surplus.
  * Check to see which pair has a smaller magnitude. Define this value to be `SMALL_VAL`.
  * Create a `Payment` object with a `Cost` of `SMALL_VAL`, and payee and payer as the two individuals within the first pair and last pair retrieved respectively. Add this `Payment` object to the list of `Payment` objects.
  * If the pairs do not have equal magnitude, remove the pair with the surplus value of smaller magnitude from the list. Calculate the new surplus value of the other pair to be the sum of the surpluses of both pairs. Update the other pair with this new surplus value and place it back into the list.
  * If the pairs do have equal magnitude, remove both pairs from the list.
  
* Return the list of `Payment` objects.

The following diagram shows the flow of the algorithm.

The following activity diagram shows what happens when a user executes a `calculatepayments` command.

![CalculatePaymentsActivityDiagram](images/CalculatePaymentsActivityDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `calculatepayments` mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. A valid `calculatepayments` command is given as user input. This prompts the `LogicManager` to run its execute()
method.

Step 2. The `CalculatePaymentsCommandParser` parses the input and checks for presence of the `GROUP_NAME` prefix.
It checks that the `GROUP_NAME` is valid (does not have any non-alphanumeric characters).
It returns a `CalculatePaymentsCommand`.

Step 3. `CalculatePaymentsCommand` runs its execute() method which checks if a group with the `GROUP_NAME` entered by the user has been
created in the past. If so, this group is retrieved from the model.

Step 4. Subsequently, the **Algorithm** is used to tabulate a list of `Payment` objects.

Step 5. The `PaymentList` field is updated with the generated list of payments, triggering a change in the UI to show the user the list of payments.

Step 6. Upon successful execution, `CommandResult` is returned.


The following sequence operation shows how the `calculatepayments` operation works.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `CalculatePaymentsCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

**Note: When a `Person` is deleted from contacts or removed from the group, the functioning of this command does not change. The deleted person may still be part of the list of payments depending on the expenses they had previously.**

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: Algorithm utilised for calculatepayments:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Prioritise settling of bigger debts 
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Pros: Smaller number of transactions.
    * Cons: Larger value transactions.

* **Alternative 2:** Prioritise settling of smaller debts
    * Pros: Smaller value transactions.
    * Cons: Greater number of transactions.
    * Cons: More difficult to implement.

* **Justification**
    * The size of the transaction matters less to the user than the volume of transactions.
    * Moreover, an easier implementation reduces the possibility of bugs.
    * As such, we chose to prioritise the settling of bigger debts in our algorithm.
  

### UI Display
AWE has multiple lists / views to display such as for `groups`, `contacts` and `expenses`.

The display, called view panel, will only be able to show up 1 view at a time depending on the command. It is of upmost importance to get it to display the correct view.

To achieve the toggling between each view panels, we implemented the following:
* An enumeration `UiView` to contain the following `CONTACT_PAGE`, `GROUP_PAGE`, `EXPENSE_PAGE`, `TRANSACTION_SUMMARY`, `PAYMENT_PAGE`. Each enum represents a different view.
* `CommandResult` was given 6 more boolean fields, each representing a different view as well.
* `MainWindow` checks for the 6 boolean fields in `CommandResult` and passes `UiView` to `ViewPanel` for toggling the view.

The following activity diagram shows how the `MainWindow` checks and sends the `UiView` to `ViewPanel`.

#### Proposed Implementation
**Aspect: Navigating between different view**

* **Alternative 1**: Make use of JavaFx's tab
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: Unable to fully customised the layout. Have to use the standard JavaFx's tab layout.
  
* **Alternative 2 (current choice)**: Replacing the child of the view panel node<br>
    (Refer to [JavaFx tutorial](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaFxPart1.html) for more information about JavaFx)
    * Pros: More customisable in terms of layout.
    * Pros: Able to make use of existing codes.
    * Cons: More classes to implement to handle the toggling between views.
    
* **Justification**
    * We want to place the command result display below the buttons according to our [wireframe](https://www.figma.com/file/VwuDOdHr7CSyDUWb4Kwkmx/CS2103T-tP?node-id=0%3A1).
    * Using JavaFx's tab will not let us customise the layout as such.
    * Hence, replacing the child of a view panel is more appropriate.
    
### Ui Navigation Buttons
To improve the usability of AWE, buttons are implemented into the Ui to allow switching of view easily.

However, only 2 main views can be toggled by the buttons - Contacts page and Groups page.

To achieve this, the following is implemented:
* 2 buttons (`GroupViewButton` and `ContactViewButton`) for the user to click.
* Event listener for each button - `GroupButtonListener` and `ContactButtonListener`. The event listener works by calling `ViewPanel#toggleView` when the button is clicked.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the button mechanism behaves at each step. In this example, the button used is `GroupViewButton` but it can also be replaced with `ContactViewButton`.

Step 1. When `GroupViewButton` is initiated, an event listener `GroupButtonListener` is created and used.

Step 2. Once the user clicks on `GroupViewButton`, the event listener will trigger and the `GroupButtonListener#handle` will run. This calls `ViewPanel#toggleView` and passes `UiView.GROUP_PAGE` as parameters. 

Step 3. `ViewPanel` will change the child of itself to `ContactListPanel` (Refer to [JavaFx tutorial](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaFxPart1.html) for more information about JavaFx). Hence, GUI will update to show contact page


### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `contacts`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `contacts`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clearalldata`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* travels in groups
* wants to split expenses in a convenient and efficient manner
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**:

Travellers have big notes that make settling payments inconvenient.
Most travel groups often designate one person to pay.
This method of settling payments poses a vexing task of splitting costs at the end of the day or on-the-spot.
Our app effectively splits bills between different contacts to serve this purpose.
