Around the World in $80 (AWE) is a desktop app for keeping track of spending and expenditure during travels, splitting 
expenses with travel-mates, and facilitating easy recollection of debts at the end of every trip. AWE is the world's
only bespoke app designed for group travellers.

The app promises to revolutionise the group-travel space. With AWE, bills can be split and monitored in a centralised
manner that minimises the potential for disputes and maximises the efficiency of payment and recollection of debts.

AWE's vision is a more interconnected world where relationships are more easily built and maintained.
Our mission is to accomplish through a user-centric approach that seeks to provide the user with what they need, at the
tip of their fingertips. This document marks the first step towards the accomplishment of that mission, and the
beginning of your journey around the world.

## 1. About the Document

The purpose of this document is to make sure that you have a pleasant and intuitive experience when using our app.
In line with our user-centric approach, the guide is structured to ensure that the knowledge of the workings of our app
is easily accessible.
The document serves as a guide for users to understand the way to use our app to extract maximum satisfaction.

**To accomplish this, we have taken the following steps**
* We provide you with a glossary of contents to explain away some vocabulary that you might find confusing, so that you 
can focus on exploring AWE to the full extent of its functionalities.
* We provide you with the tools to be able to read this guide with little need for re-referencing previous sections.

[Section 1](#1-about-the-document) provides readers with a brief overview of how to use this document. [Section 2](#2-quick-start) details the setting up of AWE
and [Section 3](#2-features) documents the main features of AWE. If you still face problems using AWE, refer to our FAQ in [Section 4](#4-faq). 
For a summary of all the commands available, refer to [Section 5](#5-command-summary).

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 1.1 Glossary

Term | Explanation
--------|------------------
**Command Line Interface (CLI)** | The Command Line Interface, or CLI for short, is the user interface on which AWE is based. This means that most of AWE's functionality is unlocked by the typing of inputs by the user, rather than the clicking of a mouse or the selection of options via a menu.
**Graphical User Interface (GUI)** | The Graphical User Interface, or GUI for short, is a user interface which supports all of its features through the clicking of a mouse or the selection of options via a menu. It does not require users to type in commands.
**Command** | Commands are the user inputs that trigger the specific features of the app. Commands are often denoted in highlighted letters. For instance, to create a group, the `creategroup` command is utilised. 
**Parameter** | A Parameter refers to a specific detail required for a command. For instance, adding a person within an app would require a details such as the person's name. In this case, the name is a parameter of this command. Parameters are often denoted in the guide in highlighted uppercase letters, for eg. `NAME`.

### 1.2 Format of commands
If you wish to jump straight into using our features, refer to Section 5 for the summary of commands.
Here are some pointers to take note of.
1. Words in `UPPER_CASE` are parameters to be supplied by you.
2. Words that are enclosed in `[   ]` denote optional parameters that the user can choose to enter or leave out.
3. You will notice that our commands require you to use characters such as `e/`, `t/`, etc. This is allows our programme
to locate which words belong to which category of input.

## 2. Quick start
AWE's primary asset is its speed. Unlike traditional Graphic User Interfaces (GUIs) which rely on slow actions such as mouse clicking and selection of options from long menus, with its CLI, AWE offers users the benefit of speed.
For those who type fast, the app will be faster than most mainstream contact management apps.
For those who are not as fast, familiarity with the commands over time will allow you to harness the full capabilities of AWE.

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer. Follow [this guide](https://www.codejava.net/java-se/download-and-install-java-11-openjdk-and-oracle-jdk) to install it.

2. Download the latest `awe.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F13-1/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your tp.

4. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/AweUi.png)
   
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>

   * **`creategroup`** : The command `creategroup gn/Bali n/John Doe n/Jane Doe t/friends` creates a group named Bali containing members `John Doe` and `Jane Doe`, with the tag `friends`.

   * **`deletegroup`** : The command `deletegroup gn/Bali` removes the group named Bali.
   
   * **`addexpense`** : The command `addexpense n/Alex Yeoh gn/Bali $/50 d/drinks` adds an expense paid for by `Alex Yeoh` into the group `Bali` of `$50` for `drinks`.

   * **`deleteexpense`** : The command `deleteexpense 1` removes the 1st expense (by one-based-index) from the list of expenses visible to the user.
   
   * **`transactionsummary `** : The command `transactionsummary  gn/Bali` provides a list of spending made by each user in the group named Bali.

   * **`calculatepayments`** : The command `calculatepayments gn/Bali` provides a list of payments to be made between users to settle debts for the group named Bali.

   * **`clear`** : The command `clear` removes all expenses / contacts / groups.

## 3. Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
