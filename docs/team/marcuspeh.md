### Project: Around the World in $80

Around the World in $80 is a desktop application that splits bills between different contacts. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project. [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=marcuspeh&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&since=2021-09-17)

### Features
* **New Feature**: Added the ability to change between contacts and groups view.
  * What it does: Allows the user to see groups / contacts with a command.
  * Justification: This feature is crucial as the user should be able to view the groups and contacts created.
  * Highlights: This implementation added in a new command `groups` to see all groups. It changes the command `list` to `contacts`. `contacts` allows the user to see all contacts.
